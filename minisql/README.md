This is a console app that lets you keep track of people assigned to projects using a sql database, to connect to it you need to create a app.config file and have the postgresql connection string inside the minisql folder. Once you have that and you have all the nuget packages installed (which are Npgsql and Dapper) you can simply run the app and you will be able to create people, projects and keep track of how many hours each person has worked on a individual project.

The code has comments on it so that should answer any questions you might have.
